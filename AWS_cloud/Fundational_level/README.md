## Introduction to AWS Inferentia and Amazon EC2 Inf1 Instances
[AWS Inferentia](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=42195) covers machine learning inference processing challenges. This video gives just a brief introduction into the `AWS Inf1` service, its more of an sales pitch, thus barely having technical information.

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework
What is the [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)?  What is important to know? What should I keep in mind?</br>
The WAF contains best practices and ways to measure your architecture design. It focuses onto five different areas:
- Operational excellence
 Understand business and customer needs, also create supporting processes which should be able to evolve.
- Security
Protect information and system using detective controls, data protection, access management, and incident response.
- Reliability
The ability to recover from failure.
- Performance efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently.
- Cost effectiveness
Avoid unneeded cost with the help of e.g. auto scaling.

The key is to understand `design decisions in a cloud native way` and it's impact, by providing general design principles.

The course can be found [here](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=42036).
